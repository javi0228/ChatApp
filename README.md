## About ChatApp

ChatApp is a web app that is in development. I started with this web page in order to improve my skills with Laravel/Vue3 stack and SPA. The back and front is in the same proyect to learn about Inertia which is a new approach to building classic server-driven web apps. They call it the modern monolith.

Some of the implemented and income featurings are:

- Powerfull authentication with Jetstream
- Roles with Spatie
- State management with Vuex.
- WebSockets with Pusher for a real time chat.

New featurings are coming.
